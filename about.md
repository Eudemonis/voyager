The about page of this website should explain the reason why _you_ should be on _this_ website. It should answer the questions you have about what this website is about. And since this is a blog it most likely should answer your questions regarding the person who created the content.

But when I inquired in my personal obsession with about pages I discovered it was more of a search for the right credentials. I have the weird /trait to start disliking the art I thought so beautiful just moments earlier when the artist lists (what I consider) weird stuff about themselves. The point of an about page is (to me) to either increase the value of the content or to decrease its value.

Because this website honours inquiring I would like to you to answer the questions you might have.
